# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcossgonzalez, I used to have another github, but that was made to administrate back-end projects. Now I want to learn things from 0:
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently interested ðŸ‘€ on learning the front-end side of programming and to get back on track with back-end development
- Now I intend to learn ðŸŒ± front-end and collaborate on this community.
-  You can reach me at :e-mail: marcos.s.gonzalezjr@outlook.com
- Thanks,

  Marcos Silveira

  So this is my âœ¨ special âœ¨ new repository, where I intend to learn things from 0 to hero if life let's me - and I hope so.
