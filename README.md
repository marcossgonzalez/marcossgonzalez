# 👋 Hi, I’m @marcossgonzalez, I used to have another github @marknkw, but that was made to use as repository to personal back-end projects. Now I want to learn things from 0 and keep things clean:
- I'm currently interested 👀 on learning the front-end side of programming and to get back on track with back-end development
- Now I intend to learn 🌱 front-end and collaborate with this community.
-  You can reach me at :e-mail: marcos.s.gonzalezjr@outlook.com
- Thanks,

  Marcos Silveira

  So this is my ✨ special ✨ new repository, where I intend to learn things from 0 to hero if life let's me - and I hope so.
