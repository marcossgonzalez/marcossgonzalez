# 👋 Hi, I’m @marcossgonzalez, I used to have another github, but that was made to administrate back-end projects. Now I want to learn things from 0,
- 👀 I'm currently interested 👀 on learning the front-end side of programming and to get back on track with back-end development
- Now I intend to learn 🌱 front-end and collaborate on this community.
-  You can reach me at :e-mail: marcos.s.gonzalezjr@outlook.com

  Marcos Silveira
So this is my ✨ special ✨ new repository, where I intend to learn things from 0 to hero if life let's me.
