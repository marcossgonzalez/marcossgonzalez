<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcossgonzalez, I used to have another github @marknkw, but that was made to use as repository to personal back-end projects. Now I want to learn things from 0 and keep things clean:</h1>
<h3> I'm currently interested ðŸ‘€ on learning the front-end side of programming and to get back on track with back-end development</h3>
<p>- Now I intend to learn ðŸŒ± front-end and collaborate with this community.</p>
<p>-  You can reach me at :e-mail: marcos.s.gonzalezjr@outlook.com </p>

<p>- Thanks,

Marcos Silveira</p>

<h2>So this is my âœ¨ special âœ¨ new repository, where I intend to learn things from 0 to hero if life let's me - and I hope so.</h2>
